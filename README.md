# **Chess.com "Cheats" in Python (Use with Caution!)**

****Disclaimer**** : Using these scripts can get you banned from Chess.com. Use them responsibly or not at all.

## **Instructions:**

1. **Optimize Chess.com Interface:**

    * Set the theme to "8-bit" for both board and pieces.
    * Set piece animation to "fast" and win celebration to "none."
    * Disable highlighting moves, pre-game/post-game animations, and special themes.
2. **Window Positioning:**

    * Open Chess.com in Chrome on the left half of your screen.
    * Ideally, the window should occupy exactly half the screen width (1920px resolution assumed). This is easily achieved on Windows 10/11.
3. **Program Execution:**

    * Important: Do not move your mouse or scroll the board while the program is running.
    * Error Handling: Following these steps ensures the program runs smoothly. Errors might occur on your first or second move otherwise.
4. **First Move Handling:**

    * White Pieces: Let the program make the first move.
    * Black Pieces: The program works regardless of whether White has moved.
5. **Program Termination:**

    * The program automatically stops upon encountering a "You Win" or "Draw" screen (caused by the screen change).
    * Disabling premoves in Chess.com settings is recommended.
6. **Randomized Move Timing (Optional):**

    * Use time.sleep() to introduce random delays between program moves, reducing suspicion.
    * Consider an inverse time relationship: Longer opponent moves lead to faster program moves.

****Notes:****

* This is not recommended as it disrupts fair play.
* Chess.com has anti-cheating measures in place.

**Additional Tips:**

* Focus on improving your chess skills instead of using cheats.
* There are plenty of resources available online and offline to help you learn and grow as a player.
