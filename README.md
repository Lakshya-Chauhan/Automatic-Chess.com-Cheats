These are the cheats for chess.com in python made with use of pyautogui. (Caution : Don't use them repeatedly, You'll end up getting banned)

Use 8 bit theme for board and the same 8 bit theme for the pieces and set the animation for pieces to 'fast' and set win celebration to 'none' and turn off highlighting moves.
Also turn off pre-post game animation and also turn off special theme.

For these cheats to work. 

Also open the chess.com window in chrome browser in left half of screen. It must occupy exactly half coordinates (it's easy to do in win 10 and 11). [Assuming your pc resolution to be 1920 x 1080 pixels]
Don't move your mouse or scroll the board in process when the programm in running.

If any of the following are not done the program will throw and error on move 1st or 2nd of yours.

Also, the cheats will only work when You use them at the start of the game. If you are white then let it make the first move.
If you are black then no matter if White had already moved or hasn't You can run the program it will work in both cases.

After you win the program will automatically stop it's execution do to the error which would be caused due to change of screen to "You Win" or "Draw".
(Also it's better to disable premoves for this program)

Also you can use time.sleep() function to randomise the times in which the program will make moves to avoid the suspicion of cheating even further on chess.com. Or you can also make an inverse relation of time consumed by bot with the time consumed by opponent. Means the more time your opponent takes to move the faster you'll move.
